metadata : description of classes and object within JVM

java.lang.Modifier
provides methods and constants to decode class and member access modifier
this can be a use for identify access modifier type

why annotations
    annotations define metadata about the program
    introduced in java 5
    can be used with class, method, variables etc.

annotation declaration ->

[access specifier] @interface <AnnotationName>{
    <DataType> <MemberName>() [default value];
}

annotation utilization ->

@<AnnotationName> (member = value)
<Programming element>

types of annotations
    Marker Annotation - without any member : @Override
    Single-Valued Annotation - with single member : @SuppressWarnings("Unchecked")
    Multi-Valued Annotations - with more than one member

standard annotations
    general purpose annotations : java.lang -> @Override,@Supresswarnings,@Depricated
    meta annotations : java.lang.annotation -> @Documented,@Inherited,@Target,@Retention

meta annotations are useful for create our own custom annotations

@Documented
    in java when we generate documentation for any class using javadoc tool or html file for any class
using javadoc tool that document will not include the annotation information. But we added @Documented
then it enable to document process to inclue the annotation types information in the generated document
along with other information.

@Inherited
    when we add this annotation to class A then after class B will extend class A
class B automatically getting class A annotation

@Target
    this is used to define target entity to which the particular annotation can be used
    eg: variables,methods,classes,packages

@Retention
    used to define how long the particular annotation should be retained
    source retention will remove in compile time
    class retention will remove by jvm. this is default
    runtime retention policy exist when code execute by jvm

reflection API is managing annotations
reflection help us to get information about annotation members and values

how to generate javadoc class?
    in terminal type javadoc classpath
    after execute open index.html
    then browser will redirect to url


java 8 added two new features to annotations
    Type annotations
    Repeating annotations : from this we can add same annotation can use multiple types for same element

for read the annotation we use reflection API
